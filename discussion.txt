    0-AlexNet needs early stopping at epoch 8?? How?
    1-VGG to be deleted or kept?
        -VGG built in needs early stoppping 
           fixing confusion matrix
        -VGG from Scratch model seems incorrect 
        because val accuracy is always fix 
    2-Inception
	-Fix model summary
	-a couple of more epochs?
    3-ResNet 
       - model summaries?,
       -No need to improve because different varaiants are just trials
    to learn
    4-New Model: early stopping
    
    	-- change the order of models based on the accuracy?
	---Readme: update
